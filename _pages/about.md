My name is Emily, I am a Biostatistics PhD student at the Institute of Cancer Research, supervised by Professor Christina Yap. My research interests lie in adaptive early phase trials, and I am currently developing novel bayesian adaptive designs which incorporate Patient Reported-Outcomes. More broadly speaking, I love to read about and implement bayesian and Monte Carlo methods. My aim is to continue introducing novel statitsical methodology within the realm adaptive trials.   

Up until July 2024, I was also an Enrichment Student at the Alan Turing Institute. I was awarded an integrated masters in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Warwick and have previously worked as a research assistant at the MRC Biostatistics Unit at the University of Cambridge.
