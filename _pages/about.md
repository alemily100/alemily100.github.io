My name is Emily, I am a Biostatistics Postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford within the Oxford-GSK Centre for Biostatistics and AI in Medicine, CeBAM working with Professor Tom Rainforth. I work on small data at the Big Data Institute. 

My research interests lie in adaptive early phase trials and optimal experimental design. My aim is to continue introducing novel statitsical methodology within the realm of adaptive trials.   

I previously completed a PhD at the Institute of Cancer Research integrating Patient-reported Outcomes within dose-finding trials and bayesian adaptive trial methodology supervised by Professor Christina Yap. 

Until July 2024, I was an Enrichment Student at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/former-enrichment-students/emily-alger). I was awarded an integrated masters in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Warwick and have previously worked as a research assistant at the MRC Biostatistics Unit at the University of Cambridge.
