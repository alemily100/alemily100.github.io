My name is Emily, I am a Biostatistics PhD student at the Institute of Cancer Research, supervised by Professor Christina Yap. My research interests lie in adaptive early phase trials, and I am currently developing novel bayesian adaptive dose-finding trial designs which incorporate Patient-Reported Outcomes. More broadly speaking, I love to read about and implement novel bayesian methods. My aim is to continue introducing novel statitsical methodology within the realm of adaptive trials.   

Until July 2024, I was an Enrichment Student at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/former-enrichment-students/emily-alger). I was awarded an integrated masters in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Warwick and have previously worked as a research assistant at the MRC Biostatistics Unit at the University of Cambridge.
